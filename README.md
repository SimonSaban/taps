# taps

This was a excercise I came across and really enjoyed working on.
Generally speaking this is round robin scheduling problem, we have some taps and a queue of bottles that are meant to be filled by them. Everything is explained in detail within the notebook along with all that is expected from a suggested solution.
My aim was to offer a simple and elegant solution at every stage.
It was interesting and enjoyable to explore test cases for this problem and understand the different factors that impact the overall result, as the problem evolves and becomes more complex.
Always happy to receive constructive feedback and learn new things.
