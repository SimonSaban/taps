# taps

This was a excercise I came across and really enjoyed working on.<br>
Generally speaking this is round robin scheduling problem, we have some taps and a queue of bottles that are meant to be filled by them. Everything is explained in detail within the notebook along with all that is expected from a suggested solution.<br>
My aim was to offer a simple and elegant solution at every stage.<br>
It was interesting and enjoyable to explore test cases for this problem and understand the different factors that impact the overall result, as the problem evolves and becomes more complex.<br>
Always happy to receive constructive feedback and learn new things.
