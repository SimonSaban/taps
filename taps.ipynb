    "# Overview\n",
    "There is a queue at a festival for people to fill up their water bottles. Your task is to calculate the total time required for each person to fill up their water bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement\n",
    "You’ll need to create a function that takes two inputs:\n",
    "1. An array of integers: which represents a queue of people, and each integer is the size of their water bottle in millilitres. For instance, the array of:\n",
    "[400, 750, 1000]\n",
    "represents a queue of three people, where the first person in the queue has a water bottle of 400ml,\n",
    "the second person in the queue has a water bottle of 750ml, and the last person in the queue has a\n",
    "water bottle of 1 litre.\n",
    "2. An integer: which represents the number of taps at the festival available for people to use for filling up their water bottles.\n",
    "This function should then return the total number of seconds that it takes for all people to have filled their water bottles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "You must assume that as soon as one tap is free, the next person in the queue starts using that tap and that they cannot move to a different tap once they start filling their bottle. You must also assume that each tap flows at a rate of 100ml per second (e.g., a 1 litre bottle takes 10 seconds).\n"

You should write another function (which adapts your previous one slightly) to take account of the fact that different taps may flow at different rates (e.g., the first tap flows at 50ml per second while the second tap flows at 200ml per second). You should still assume that each person uses the first available tap."

    "- as we can see at 125ml/s tap 2 with the highest capacity ends up as the one to fill the last bottle in the queue, and it's only idle for 0.1s while tap 1 is idle for 4 seconds\n",
    "- by increasing the flow rate of tap 2 further to 200ml/s or 500ml/s, tap 2 fills bottles quicker, the allocation of bottles from the queue to available taps changes, and it's tap 1 that ends up with the last bottle from the queue while the time of tap 2 (our best worker) is wasted as it's idle for nearly 6s or 10s respectively, meaning the workload ditribution isn't the most efficient and doesn't maximize the productivity of our taps"
